# AI Volatility Predictor: A Financial Risk Analytics Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive **data science solution** that predicts the **future volatility of financial assets**.  
It showcases a **full-stack data science workflow**, from data acquisition and rigorous model building to deployment in an interactive web application.

---

##  Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a reliable forecast of a stock's **short-term volatility**, a key measure of risk for investors and analysts.  
The solution uses **historical market data** to train a machine learning model, which is then served through a **user-friendly web interface**.

###  Core Components
- **Data Engineering** ‚Üí Sourcing, cleaning, and transforming raw financial data  
- **Machine Learning** ‚Üí Training a robust regression model to make predictions  
- **Model Validation & Backtesting** ‚Üí Proving the model's reliability with rigorous evaluation across multiple time periods  
- **Deployment** ‚Üí Creating an interactive dashboard to make the model accessible to anyone  

---

###  Key Features
- **Real-time Predictions** ‚Üí Instant volatility forecast for any stock by entering its ticker symbol  
- **Interactive Dashboard** ‚Üí Built with Streamlit, visualizing historical price movements, volatility trends, and clear risk assessments  
- **Advanced Methodology** ‚Üí Uses **XGBoost**, hyperparameter tuning, and a rigorous backtesting strategy  
- **Model Transparency** ‚Üí Displays the most important features influencing the model‚Äôs predictions  
- **Walk-Forward Backtesting** ‚Üí Validates the model over multiple rolling time windows to simulate real-world performance

## üìê Methodology & Mathematical Concepts

The model works by identifying patterns in historical data. Several features were engineered using **financial and mathematical concepts**.

---

### 1. Logarithmic Returns
Daily log returns \( r_t \):

\[
r_t = \ln \left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right)
\]

Where:  
- \( P_t \) = Price on day *t*

---

### 2. Historical Volatility
The target variable is **annualized historical volatility** \( \sigma_P \):

\[
\sigma_P = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (r_i - \bar{r})^2} \times \sqrt{252}
\]

Where:  
- \( n = 21 \) (rolling window in days)  
- \( \bar{r} \) = Mean daily log return  
- 252 ‚âà trading days in a year  

---

### 3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Momentum oscillator used to measure the speed & change of price movements:

\[
RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}
\]

Where:

\[
RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}
\]

---

### 4. Model Performance & Rigorous Backtesting

We evaluated the model using **R-squared (\(R^2\))**, which measures how much of the variance in the target variable is predictable from the features.

\[
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
\]

Where:  
- \( y_i \) = Actual volatility  
- \( \hat{y}_i \) = Predicted volatility  
- \( \bar{y} \) = Mean actual volatility  

---

#### Backtesting Process
Unlike a single train/test split, **backtesting** simulates how the model would have performed over multiple rolling periods in the past.  
This is represented mathematically as a sequence of train/test splits that "walk forward" in time.

For each split \( k \in \{1, ‚Ä¶, K\} \):

- **Train**:  
\[
D^{train}_k = \{(x_t, y_t) \mid t \in [T_0, T_k]\}
\]

- **Test**:  
\[
D^{test}_k = \{(x_t, y_t) \mid t \in [T_k, T'_k]\}
\]

This process yields a series of performance scores.  
Our model achieved a **robust average \( R^2 = 0.9492 \)** from backtesting.
