# AI-Volatility-Predictor-A-Financial-Risk-Analytics-Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive data science solution that predicts the future volatility of financial assets. It showcases a full-stack data science workflow, from data acquisition and rigorous model building to deployment in an interactive web application.

Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a reliable forecast of a stock's short-term volatility, a key measure of risk for investors and analysts. The solution uses historical market data to train a machine learning model, which is then served through a user-friendly web interface.

The core components of this project are:

Data Engineering: Sourcing, cleaning, and transforming raw financial data.

Machine Learning: Training a robust regression model to make predictions.

Model Validation: Proving the model's reliability with professional-grade evaluation techniques.

Deployment: Creating an interactive dashboard to make the model accessible to anyone.

Key Features
Real-time Predictions: Get an instant volatility forecast for any stock by simply entering its ticker symbol.

Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit, the app visualizes historical price movements, volatility trends, and a clear risk assessment.

Advanced Methodology: The model is based on advanced techniques like XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning, and a rigorous backtesting strategy.

Model Transparency: The app displays the most important features that influence the model's predictions, providing insight into its decision-making process.

Methodology & Mathematical Concepts
This project's model works by identifying patterns in historical data. We engineered several features based on financial and mathematical concepts.

Logarithmic Returns: We calculated the daily log returns (r_t) of a stock, which are often used in finance because they are additive over time and have better statistical properties than simple returns.
r_t=
ln(
fracP_tP_t−1)
where P_t is the price on day t.

Historical Volatility: Our target variable for prediction is the annualized historical volatility (
sigma_P). This is a key measure of risk and is calculated as the standard deviation of the daily log returns over a 21-day rolling window, annualized by scaling with the square root of 252 (the approximate number of trading days in a year).

 (r_i−barr)

times
sqrt252
where n=21 is the number of days, and 
barr is the mean daily log return.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator is a technical indicator used in the model to measure the speed and change of price movements.
RSI=100−
frac1001+RS
where RS=
fracAverageGainAverageLoss

Model Performance: We evaluated our model using the R-squared (R 
2
 ) score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features. An R-squared of 0.9471 indicates our model can explain over 94% of the volatility.
